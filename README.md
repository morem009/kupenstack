Kubernetes-Native OpenStack

A Sandbox Project.

---

Have you used OpenStack before? If so, then for you KupenStack is magic:sparkles: that lets you use OpenStack with `kubectl` utility. This is all you need to know as a novice:bust_in_silhouette: getting started.

## Overview

KupenStack is an open-source project for managing OpenStack resources and OpenStack infrastructure in a Kubernetes cluster. 

It provides CRDs to declaratively deploy, manage, and scale OpenStack resources in a Kubernetes cluster. While it also provides an operator to lcm a self-managed OpenStack cluster alongside the Kubernetes cluster.
